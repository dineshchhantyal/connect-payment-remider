<h3>A notification system that sends reminders for bill payments or subscription renewals, with payment links and instructions.</h3>
<p>The goal of this project is to develop a notification system that helps individuals and businesses keep track of their bill payments and subscription renewals. The system will send reminders prior to the due date, along with payment links and instructions, to ensure that payments are made on time and avoid late fees or service interruptions.

The system will be designed to be user-friendly and customizable, allowing users to set up their own reminders and preferences. Users will be able to choose the frequency and timing of reminders, as well as the preferred method of communication (e.g. email, SMS, push notifications).</p>

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
